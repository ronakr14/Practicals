    "In Python, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, allowing for greater flexibility in program design. First, you define the functions you want to use, such as add() and multiply(). Then, you create a higher-order function like apply_operation() that takes another function as an argument and applies it to the given parameters, enabling dynamic behavior in your code."

    "A generator is a special type of iterator that is created using a function with one or more yield statements.\n",
